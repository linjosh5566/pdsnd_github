### Comment
I work in night shift, and i have to switch to daily time when off work.
So time is extremely no enough for me, it takes a lot of effort to finish all these course.
Those project are all challenging but i learned a lot.
This might not be the end of learning, I would keep learn for machine learning stuff!
